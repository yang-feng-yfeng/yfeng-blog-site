It should be because of my old age. Recently, I have been searching for an answer to a question: what is the meaning of human existence? This question is not new; it has been a problem that troubled ancient philosophers since the Athenian period in Greece. On this point, our Chinese ancient philosophers are a bit dimmer. Clearly, our ancient philosophers preferred to discuss politics, governance, and other topics. In the end, did humans come to this world with a mission or to live impulsively?

There are many schools of thought on this issue. Personally, I like two schools of thought the most. They seem to contradict each other, but behind them, they seem to be talking about the same thing: that doing things is the best. One is the Stoics, who advocate simply doing what one should do and not worrying about what one cannot control. The other is Aristotle, who said that doing things is not for others but for the best version of oneself, to strive for the best version of oneself.

Later, there was Marx, who said that people were alienated in capitalism. People are not like people, they live like animals, working to earn money, and then spending it on basic needs such as food, drink, and entertainment. They are like old cows driven to turn the mill by their farmers, and their work is only for the sake of satisfying basic needs, and the flour produced will not bring any meaning.

So, this blog was born. By doing things myself, I have solved the meaning of human existence. And it's not something that is alienated by capitalism, because I haven't taken a penny, so there's no possibility of being alienated.
